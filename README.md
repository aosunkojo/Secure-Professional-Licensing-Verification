# Secure Professional Licensing Verification

A blockchain-based system for transparent, tamper-proof verification of professional licenses and credentials.

## Overview

This decentralized application (dApp) leverages blockchain technology to create a secure, efficient system for issuing, tracking, and verifying professional licenses across industries. By using smart contracts, the platform eliminates fraud, reduces administrative overhead, and provides real-time verification of professional qualifications for employers, regulatory bodies, and the public.

## System Architecture

The system consists of four primary smart contracts working together:

1. **License Issuance Contract**
    - Records and verifies professional qualifications and credentials
    - Manages the issuance of new licenses by authorized regulatory bodies
    - Stores immutable records of education, training, and examination results
    - Creates unique digital license identifiers linked to professional identities

2. **Status Tracking Contract**
    - Monitors the active/suspended/revoked status of all licenses
    - Enables regulatory bodies to update license status in real-time
    - Implements time-based automatic status changes (for expirations)
    - Records status change history with timestamps and reasons

3. **Continuing Education Contract**
    - Tracks required ongoing training and professional development
    - Verifies completion of continuing education units (CEUs)
    - Integrates with approved education providers
    - Automates renewal eligibility based on completed requirements

4. **Verification Request Contract**
    - Manages inquiries from employers, clients, or other stakeholders
    - Processes verification requests with appropriate privacy controls
    - Generates cryptographically secured verification certificates
    - Records audit trail of all verification activities

## Key Features

- **Immutability**: Once recorded, credentials cannot be altered or falsified
- **Real-time Verification**: Instant confirmation of current license status
- **Reduced Fraud**: Eliminates counterfeit licenses and misrepresentation
- **Privacy Controls**: Professionals control what information is shared and with whom
- **Administrative Efficiency**: Reduces paperwork and manual verification processes
- **Cross-jurisdictional Recognition**: Facilitates license recognition across different regions
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensures adherence to industry standards and requirements

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ethereum wallet (MetaMask recommended)
- ETH for gas fees (or industry-specific token if implemented)
- Digital identity solution for identity verification
- Required professional credentials documents

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/secure-licensing-verification.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure your environment variables:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit the `.env` file with your specific configuration settings.

4. Deploy the contracts:
   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network [your-network]
   ```

### License Registration Process

1. Connect your wallet to the dApp
2. Complete identity verification through the integrated KYC provider
3. Submit required credentials and qualifications:
    - Educational certificates
    - Examination results
    - Prior work experience
    - Reference information
4. Pay the registration fee
5. Await verification by the regulatory authority
6. Receive your digital license as an NFT and/or cryptographic attestation

### Data Flow

1. Professional submits credentials to License Issuance Contract
2. Regulatory authority verifies and approves the license
3. Status Tracking Contract begins monitoring the license status
4. Continuing Education Contract tracks ongoing professional development
5. Employers/clients can request verification through the Verification Request Contract
6. System provides cryptographically secured verification of current license status

## User Guides

### For Professionals

1. Register and create your professional profile
2. Submit required documentation for license issuance
3. Monitor your license status and expiration dates
4. Track and submit continuing education credits
5. Approve or deny verification requests

### For Regulatory Bodies

1. Set up authorized verifier accounts
2. Review and approve/deny license applications
3. Update license status as needed (suspension, revocation)
4. Define continuing education requirements
5. Access analytics on licensing trends and compliance

### For Verifiers (Employers/Clients)

1. Submit verification requests for professional licenses

## Development Guide

### Local Development Environment

1. Start a local blockchain:
   ```
   npx hardhat node
   ```

2. Deploy contracts to local network:
   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```
   npx hardhat test
   ```

### Contract Customization

- License requirements can be configured in `contracts/LicenseIssuance.sol`
- Status rules and triggers can be modified in `contracts/StatusTracking.sol`
- Continuing education parameters can be adjusted in `contracts/ContinuingEducation.sol`
- Verification request permissions can be set in `contracts/VerificationRequest.sol`

## Deployment

### Testnet Deployment

1. Ensure your wallet has sufficient test ETH
2. Configure the network in `hardhat.config.js`
3. Run the deployment script:
   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
   ```

### Mainnet Deployment

1. Update contract addresses in configuration files
2. Set appropriate gas limits and prices
3. Deploy with:
   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mainnet
   ```
